# API

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your server middleware.
Server middleware let you register additional routes (typically /api routes) without need for an external server.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/configuration-glossary/configuration-servermiddleware).
