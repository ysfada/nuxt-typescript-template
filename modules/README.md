# MODULES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

Modules are Nuxt.js extensions which can extend the framework's core functionality and add endless integrations.
Once you have installed the modules you can then add them to your nuxt.config.ts file under the modules property.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/modules).
